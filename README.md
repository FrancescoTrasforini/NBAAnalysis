# NBAAnalysis
A small project carried out to learn basic R functionalities.
The purpose of the research is to test the hypothesis that 3rd quarters are particularly significant towards final results of NBA games.

e.g. winning the third quarter results in a higher probability of winning the game compared with the probability of winning the game computed for a team winning the second quarter

The data was collected from the recaps offered by google and organized in an Excel file.
The info stored in the Excel table are: Home_team, Away_team, 1stQrtPoints_HT, 1stQrtPoints_AT, 2ndQrtPoints_HT, 2ndQrtPoints_AT, 3rdQrtPoints_HT, 3rdQrtPoints_AT, 4thQrtPoints_HT,
4thQrtPoints_AT,ovrtPointsHT, ovrtPointsHT, totPointsHT, totPointsAT.
The dataset of interest is playoff games of the 2020 season.

The analysis shows that no quarter is statistically more impactful than another.
